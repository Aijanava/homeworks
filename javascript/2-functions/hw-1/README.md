### 1. The Fortune Teller: With Functions!

Let's turn one of the "Intro To Programming" Exercises into a function.

- Write a function named `tellFortune` that:
  - takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
  - outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
- Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.
